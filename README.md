##Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to use semantic versioning for its tagging. 
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

### The general format

- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes, e.g. `1.0.1`
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
