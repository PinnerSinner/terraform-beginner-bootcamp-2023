They would often stuff sheep's organs with meat, spices &amp; everything nice and boil it altogether using their pointy medieval helmets as a stove over an open flame.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>Funnily enough, it became so popular that the dish quickly exported across the British isles. Interestingly, during the reign of King Renton IV, haggis was banned because it was believed to be an aphrodisiac that could lead to immoral behaviour. The ban was lifted sometime after midday that same day once people began getting a wee bit peckish again.<br>
                        <br>It may sound strange, but it's actually quite delicious!

                        <br>This blood sport was coined by Monks who would take turns slapping one another until only the champion was left standing. As the sport grew in popularity, a type of blood sausage was made from the leftover blood, oatmeal, and black pepper. It's often served as part of a full English breakfast, and beloved by several!

                      <p class="u-hover-feature u-text u-text-2"> A steamed pudding made with suet and dried fruit, usually served with custard or cream. Legend has it that the dish was named after notorious highwayman Dick Van Dyke, who would often hide out in the countryside and steal from unsuspecting travelers.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>One day, a travelling group of bakers were making a delicious steamed pudding and whilst deciding how to name their new meal, spotted Dick Van Dyke appearing unexpectedly to rob the bakers. Fearing for their lives, the bakers gave him the recipe and named the dish after the encounter.&nbsp;<br>

In fact, it was named after a cautionary catchphrase after a golf tournament at Hertfordshire driving range, where the local golf course was overrun by an infestation of Cane Toads - a giant neotropical toad with poison glands that are highly toxic to humans. The dish was named in tribute to the deceased, may they croak in peace.</p>

                      <p class="u-hover-feature u-text u-text-2"> An appetising pie made with PG Tips soaked tea bags (usually Extra Bold, though I also like Jasmine), potatoes, onions, and serving of tea bags on the side. To make this dish even more British, be sure to use Earl Grey tea for a subtle bergamot flavor.&nbsp;Note that we reuse tea-bags here, we're not savages.<br>
                        <br>And don't forget to add a generous splash of Worcestershire sauce for that extra umami kick! My family's secret recipe is to&nbsp;simmer the lights and whisper "Worcestershire" into the bathroom mirror 3 times to summon the flavour-sealing spirits - works 70% of the time, every time!

                      <p class="u-hover-feature u-text u-text-4"> A hearty casserole made with swan meat (which is legal, and encouraged,&nbsp;to eat in the UK), potatoes, carrots, onions, and herbs. To prepare the swan meat, you'll first need to kidnap a swan from your local park. This is easier than it sounds since they're quite tame and extremely docile. Usually a net and some breadcrumbs will do, though I prefer to wrangle mine by hand since the width of their necks are perfectly sized for my palms.<br>
                        <br>&nbsp;Once you've caught your swan, be sure to keep it in a dark, cramped space - such as Luton - for about a week before cooking. This will help tenderise the meat and give its&nbsp;unique flavour. Once your swan is fully traumatised, it's time to prepare it for cooking. Remove the feathers and beak, then carefully draw a pentagram on the floor before extracting the meat from the bones. Be sure to save the bones for later since they make a great stock - every little helps!&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>You'll want to sauté some onions and garlic in butter until they're soft and fragrant. Add some diced carrots and potatoes, then pour in enough Powerade to let everything soak. Add the swan meat and bones, along with some fresh herbs like thyme and rosemary. Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least an hour. Serve it up with some crusty bread and a glass of red wine - your guests (if you had any) will be amazed by the unique flavor of this dish!
